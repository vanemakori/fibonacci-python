## Fibonacci sequence in python 2.7

The first code implements the sequence without using a function(fibonacci_1.py) and the second one implements the same method using functions (fibonacci_2.py).

## The sequence

It starts with zero, if you want it to start from 1 onwards excluding the zero, just change the following values

* ```const = [1,1]```

* ```for i in range(2,n)```

* ```const = const[i-1] + const[i-2]```

Enjoy problem solving :)
